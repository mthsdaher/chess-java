# CHESS GAME

Develop a **chess game system in Java**, leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and concepts including exceptions, abstract classes, and data structures.

## Java Concepts Used:

- **Encapsulation:** Restricting direct access to some of an object's components.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes based on existing ones.
- **Polymorphism:** Allowing methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
- **Downcasting:** Casting a superclass reference to a subclass reference to access specific behaviors or properties.
- **Exceptions:** Handling errors and other exceptional events.
- **Abstract Classes/Methods:** Defining classes and methods that cannot be instantiated and must be overridden.
- **Enumerations:** Defining a set of named constants.
- **Access Modifiers:** Controlling visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables.
- **Static Members:** Using class-level fields and methods.
- **Layers Pattern:** Organizing code in different layers to separate concerns.
- **Defensive Programming:** Ensuring the program operates under unforeseen circumstances.
- **Data Structures:** Utilizing matrices and lists to manage data.
- **Special Chess Moves:** Implementing castling, en passant, and promotion.
